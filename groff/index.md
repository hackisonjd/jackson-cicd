# The Roff Document Formatting System

Mitch Feigenbaum - <https://mrf-dot.github.io>

---

## Define the Terms

- `roff` Document runoff program
- `troff` Typesetting roff
- `groff` (g/Troff) GNU troff

---

## What is Roff?

- Document preparation using computers dates back to the 1960s
- Roff is based on the original Runoff language, which predates UNIX
- Roff is what you see is what you mean (WYSIWYM), not what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG)

---

## What you need

1. Valid Groff Installation

   - Linux: It's already installed
   - Mac: `brew install groff`

2. Text Editor (VIM recommended)

---

## Macro Sets

- MAN (manual)
- MOM (my own macros)
- MS (used in this presentation)
- ME
- MM

---

```

---

## Using Groff MS

- Macros begin on a new line with a period

```roff
.TL
```

- The content (text) corresponding to the macro is on the following line

```roff
.TL
title
```

- Some macros take arguments, such as the `.IP` macro

```roff
.IP \(bu
```

---

## Groff MS Macros

1. Report Cover
2. Document Content
3. Text Styling
4. Document Preprocessors

---

## Report Cover Macros

- `.RP [no]` (Report Cover) [no indicates header on second page]
- `.TL` (Title)
- `.AU` (Author)
- `.AI` (Institution)
- `.AB [no]` (Abstract Start) [no indicates **ABSTRACT** not printed]
- `.AE` (Abstract End)

---

## Headings

- `.NH [number]` (Numbered Header) [number indicates level]

```groff
.NH 1
Top Level
.NH 2
Second level
.NH 3
Third level
```

- `.SH` (Section Header)

---

## Paragraphs

- `.PP` (Paragraph)
- `.LP` (Paragraph without initial indent)
- `.XP` (Paragraph with hanging indent)
- `.QP` (Quoted Paragraph)

### Quoted Paragraphs

- `.QS`
- `.QE`
- `.QS` and `.QE` can contain `.LP` and `.PP` macros

---

## Lists

- `.IP [marker [width]]`

### Unordered (bulleted) list

```groff
.IP \(bu
Apple
.IP \(bu
Banana
```

### Ordered (numbered) list

```groff
.nr a 0
.IP \n+a
Apple
.IP \n+a
Banana
```

---

## Indents

- `.RS` (Start Indented Block)
- `.RE` (End Indented Block)
- Nested indents are possible (useful for creating nested lists)

```roff
.IP 1
Point 1
.RS
. IP 1.1
Nested point 1.1
. RS
.  IP 1.1.1
Nested point 1.1.1
. RE
.RE
```

---

## Displays and Keeps

- Displays will allow you to write prose (such as lines of code)
- Keeps will try to keep the content within the blocks on the same page

| With keep        | No keep | Type of Display |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `.DS L`          | `.LD`   | Left-justified  |
| `.DS I [indent]` | `.ID`   | Indented        |
| `.DS B`          | `.BD`   | Block-centered  |
| `.DS C`          | `.CD`   | Centered        |
| `.DS R`          | `.RD`   | Right-justified |

---

## Displays and Keeps (cont.)

- `.DE` ends any display (keep or no keep)
- Text between `.KS` and `.KE` keeps text together on the page
- Text between `.KF` and `.KE` will make a floating keep (when you care that text be grouped together but don't care where)
- Text between `.B1` and `.B2` will be boxed

---

## Footnotes

- Footnotes are automatically inserted at the bottom of the page regardless of where they are declared
- `.FS` (Footnote Start)
- `.FE` (Footnote End)
- `\**` Write the footnote number as superscript
- The following example cites the footnote number and then writes the content of the footnote to be inserted at the bottom of the page

```groff
This text is in need of extra context.\**
.FS
This is the extra context we needed in the form of a footnote
.FE
Now the rest of the paragraph can proceed.
```

---

## Text Size

- `.SM` Decrement font size by 2 points (can be called multiple times)
- `.LG` Increment font size by 2 points (can be called multiple times)
- `.NL` Restore font size

---

## Text Style

- Style is controlled by the `\f` command followed by square brackets
  - `\f[B]` (bold)
  - `\f[C]` (constant width [monospace])
  - `\f[BI]` (bold _and_ italic)
  - `\f[R]` (Regular [Roman])

```groff
\f[CBI]This text is monospaced, bold, and italic. \f[R]This text is regular.
```

- Text can be boxed using the `.BX` command

```groff
.BX "This text is in a box"
```

- Text can be underlined using the `.UL` command

---

## Text color

- Color is controlled by the `\m` command followed by square brackets

```groff
\m[red]this is red text\m[green]this is green text\m[black]this is black text.
```

---

## Special characters

```text
\(Do   Dollar $
\(Eu   Euro €

```

---

## Preprocessors

- `eqn`: Equations
- `tbl`: Tables
- `refer`: Citations
- `pic`: Vector graphics
- `chem`: Chemical Equations (extension of `pic`)

---

## EQN

- All text between `.EQ` and `.EN` will be formatted as a mathematical equation

```groff
Let's show off the power of EQN by writing the quadratic formula in groff!
.EQ
x = {-b +- sqrt {b sup 2 - 4ac}} over 2a
.EN
```

---

## TBL

- All text between `.TS` and `.TE` will be formatted as a table

```groff
.TS
allbox expand;
l l.
Email mfeigenbaum23@gmail.com
Github https://github.com/mrf-dot
Website https://mrf-dot.github.io
YouTube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdJoCFI6t7DTzms9Cr3U0hQ
.TE
```

---

## Compilation

- `groff` uses pipes to convert preprocessors to `roff` code

```sh
eqn file.ms | groff | ps2pdf
```

- The `groff` command has build in flags to include preprocessors
- An output device can be chosen by using the `-T` flag

```sh
groff -e -Tpdf file.ms > file.pdf
```

- The `grog` command will automatically assume preprocessors based on file contents and run the command

```sh
grog -Tpdf file.ms --run > file.pdf
```

---

## Writing Groff with Vim

- Add these commands to your vim config to make writing groff easier

```vim
augroup Roff
 autocmd!
 autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.ms,*.me,*.mom,*.man,*.mla set filetype=groff
 autocmd BufWritePost *.ms,*.me,*.mom,*.man,*.mla :execute '!grog -Tpdf % --run > %:t:r.pdf' | redraw
augroup END
```

---

## Example Groff file

```groff
.TL
A file
.AU
<Your name>
.AI
Unix User Group
.PP
Hello, world!
```
